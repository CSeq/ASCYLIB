CONFIGURATION
------------
	1. in common/Makefile.common, goto "# Management PC specific settings"
	   and add an entry for your development laptop, e.g.,
	   if "uname -n" trigonaklaptop, you can add something like:
	   ifeq ($(PC_NAME), trigonaklaptop)
	       CFLAGS += -DMYLAPTOP
	   endif
	2. in include/measurements.h, goto #ifndef REF_SPEED_GHZ and add
	   the an entry using the "MYLAPTOP" entry with the freq of your PC
	3.  in include/utils, add an #if defined(..) entry for your platform,
	    similar to what we have for OPTERON
	4. in include/ssalloc.h make an entry for the MYLAPTOP and give
	   a sensible size to the SSALLOC_SIZE (e.g., 100 * 1024 * 1024)


INSTALL
-------  
	 check the Makefile for the different versions you can compile.
	 Example:
        make ticket
        make lockfree


RUN
---

   1. Executables for hash table, linked list, 
      skip list, lock-based linked list, lock-based hashtable, lock-based skip list
      are located in 'bin':
      ./bin/lf-ht
      ./bin/lf-ll
      ./bin/lf-sl
      ./bin/lb-ht
      ./bin/lb-ll
      ./bin/lb-sl
   2. Use parameter "--help" for the full list of parameters

USEFUL FILES
------------

	* scripts/* for executing things
	* include/atomic_ops_if.h hides some the cross-platform complexities
	* include/ssalloc.h provides the interface of a custom memory allocator
	  to be used instead of malloc
	* src/hashtable/test.c is a good example of the testing framework
	* Makefile & common/Makefile.common for compiling stuff
